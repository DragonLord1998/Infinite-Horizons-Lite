# Infinite Horizons: Phase 2 - README

## Phase 2 Completion

This document details the Phase 2 implementation of "Infinite Horizons," a procedural landscape generator that now features **shader-based procedural materials** and **enhanced exploration capabilities**. Phase 2 builds upon the core terrain generation from Phase 1 by adding visually rich materials generated entirely within shaders and providing improved camera controls.

## Key Features Implemented in Phase 2

### 1. Shader-Based Procedural Materials

- **GLSL Shader Implementation**: Enhanced vertex and fragment shaders that generate material properties procedurally
- **Material Variation by Height and Slope**: Automatically transitions between different material types based on terrain features
- **Noise-Based Detail**: Multiple layers of noise for natural-looking variation in terrain textures
- **Biome Transitions**: Smooth blending between different biome types (mountains, plains, desert, tundra)
- **Dynamic Lighting Model**: Enhanced ambient and directional lighting within the shaders

### 2. Material Parameter Control

- **Interactive Material Editor**: UI panel for adjusting material properties in real-time
- **Color Controls**: Adjustable parameters for grass, rock, snow, and sand colors
- **Material Boundaries**: Configurable height and slope thresholds for material transitions
- **Noise Parameters**: Controls for noise scale, intensity, and blending
- **Preset System**: Save and load material configurations with predefined and custom presets

### 3. Enhanced Camera Controls

- **Dual Control Modes**: 
  - **Flight Mode**: Free-flying camera for unrestricted exploration
  - **Walking Mode**: Ground-based movement that follows terrain with collision detection
- **Smooth Movement**: Acceleration/deceleration for natural movement feel
- **Terrain Adaptation**: Camera automatically adjusts to terrain height in walking mode
- **Jumping Mechanics**: Added jumping ability in walking mode

### 4. UI Improvements

- **Enhanced Minimap**: Shows loaded chunks with LOD indicators and compass
- **Mode Indicator**: Visual feedback for current camera mode
- **FPS Counter**: Performance monitoring with color-coded display
- **Help Overlay**: Comprehensive controls reference
- **Loading Screen**: Improved loading screen with progress indication

### 5. Performance Optimizations

- **Smooth LOD Transitions**: Gradual blending between LOD levels to reduce popping
- **Adaptive Rendering**: Enhanced LOD system based on distance from camera
- **Optimized Shaders**: Carefully balanced shader complexity for performance
- **Material Parameter Persistence**: Save material settings for faster startup

## Running Instructions

1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure you have a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended)
   - No external dependencies or installations needed

2. **Launch**:
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Wait for the loading screen to complete

3. **Controls**:
   - **WASD**: Move forward, left, backward, right
   - **Space/Shift**: Move up/down (flight mode) or jump (walking mode)
   - **Mouse**: Look around
   - **F**: Toggle between flight and walking modes
   - **Alt**: Sprint (2x speed)
   - **Ctrl**: Slow movement (0.5x speed)
   - **H**: Toggle help overlay
   - **M**: Toggle minimap
   - **P**: Toggle FPS display
   - **Alt+M**: Toggle material editor
   - **R**: Reset camera position
   - **G**: Toggle wireframe view
   - **Ctrl+Shift+I**: Toggle Babylon.js Inspector

4. **Material Editor**:
   - Use the material editor (Alt+M) to adjust terrain appearance
   - Experiment with presets for different visual styles
   - Save custom presets for future use

## Technical Implementation Details

### Shader-Based Materials

The procedural materials use GLSL shaders with the following key features:

1. **Vertex Shader**:
   - Calculates and passes world position, normals, UVs, and height to fragment shader
   - Computes slope for material transitions

2. **Fragment Shader**:
   - Implements multiple noise functions including Value Noise and FBM (Fractal Brownian Motion)
   - Uses domain warping for more natural noise patterns
   - Handles material blending based on height, slope, and noise
   - Implements a custom lighting model with ambient, directional, and rim lighting

3. **Material Parameters**:
   - All material properties are controlled through shader uniforms
   - Parameters include color bases, variation ranges, roughness values, and transition thresholds

### Camera System

The enhanced camera controls include:

1. **Physics-Based Movement**:
   - Implements velocity and acceleration for smooth movement
   - Handles collisions with terrain in walking mode
   - Provides gravity and jumping in walking mode

2. **Mode Switching**:
   - Seamlessly transitions between flight and walking modes
   - Adjusts control behaviors based on active mode

### LOD System Improvements

The Level of Detail (LOD) system now features:

1. **Smooth Transitions**:
   - Gradual visibility changes between LOD levels
   - Prevents jarring pop-in when LOD changes

2. **Context-Aware LOD**:
   - Considers terrain complexity in addition to distance
   - Optimizes for viewing angle and visibility

## Moving Forward

With Phase 2 complete, the project has achieved both core terrain generation and visually appealing procedural materials. The next phase will focus on:

1. **Performance & Seamlessness** (Phase 3):
   - Improving chunking system for dynamic loading/unloading
   - Implementing Web Workers for heightmap generation
   - Further enhancing seamlessness at chunk boundaries
   - Refining the LOD system for better performance

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Material transitions can sometimes appear sharp at chunk boundaries
- High complexity shader materials may impact performance on lower-end hardware
- Some ground collision edge cases in walking mode on very steep slopes

## Credits

- Built with Babylon.js 5.0
- Uses GLSL for shader programming
- Developed as part of the Infinite Horizons procedural landscape project
