# Infinite Horizons: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - README

## Project Overview (MVP)

This document describes the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for "Infinite Horizons," a project aiming to create a vast, interactive, and procedurally generated 3D landscape in the web browser. This MVP focuses on demonstrating the **core functionality of procedural terrain generation and rendering** using a simplified CPU heightmap approach.

**MVP Goal:**  To create a basic, explorable, and procedurally generated 3D landscape in the browser using Babylon.js, demonstrating core procedural generation and rendering functionality.

**Key MVP Features:**

*   **Basic Procedural Terrain Generation:**  CPU-based heightmap generation using a simple noise function.
*   **Chunked Terrain (Small Grid):** A small, fixed grid of terrain chunks loaded at startup (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5).
*   **Basic Shader-Based Procedural Materials:** Simple color variations driven by a GLSL shader and noise.
*   **Camera Exploration:**  Basic camera controls (WASD/mouse) for navigating the generated terrain.
*   **Basic Seamlessness:** Overlapping noise sampling to reduce visible seams between chunks.
*   **Basic Level of Detail (LOD):** Simple distance-based LOD by reducing heightmap resolution for distant chunks.
*   **Web Worker for Heightmap Generation:** Offloading heightmap generation to a Web Worker for improved responsiveness.

**Technology Stack (MVP):**

*   **Babylon.js:** 3D engine for rendering.
*   **JavaScript:** Core programming language.
*   **Web Workers:** For background heightmap generation.
*   **GLSL (Shaders):** For basic procedural materials.
*   **Simple Noise Function (JavaScript & GLSL):** Value Noise or Simplified Perlin.

**Timeline (Estimated - Subject to Change):**

This is a rough estimated timeline for each phase, assuming a single developer working part-time. Actual timelines may vary.

*   **Phase 1: Core Terrain Generation & Rendering (CPU - Basic Heightmap) - Estimated: 1 Week**
    *   Babylon.js Setup (Day 1)
    *   Simplified Chunking System (Day 1-2)
    *   CPU Heightmap Generation (Day 2-3)
    *   Mesh Creation (Day 3-4)
    *   Basic Unlit Material (Day 4)
    *   Camera Movement (Day 4-5)
    *   Testing and Refinement (Day 5-7)

*   **Phase 2: Basic Procedural Materials & Exploration - Estimated: 1 Week**
    *   Shader-Based Material (Basic Procedural) (Day 1-3)
    *   Material Parameter Control (JavaScript - Uniforms) (Day 3-4)
    *   Improved Camera Movement (Day 4-5)
    *   Integration and Testing (Day 5-7)

*   **Phase 3: Performance & Seamlessness (Basic Chunking & Web Workers) - Estimated: 1-2 Weeks**
    *   Chunking System (Basic Dynamic Loading) (Day 1-3)
    *   Web Workers for Heightmap Generation (Day 3-5)
    *   Overlapping Noise (Basic Seamlessness) (Day 5-7)
    *   Basic Level of Detail (LOD) - Chunk Resolution (Week 2 - Day 1-3)
    *   Integration, Optimization, and Testing (Week 2 - Day 3-7)

**Total Estimated Time for MVP: 3-4 Weeks**

**Running Instructions:**

1.  **Dependencies:** Ensure you have a web browser and a code editor (e.g., VS Code). You will need to include the Babylon.js library in your project (either via CDN or by downloading and including it locally).
2.  **Project Structure:**  (Example - Adapt as needed)
    ```
    infinite-horizons-mvp/
    ├── index.html      (Main HTML file)
    ├── app.js          (Main JavaScript application logic)
    ├── terrainGenerator.js (Heightmap generation - potentially in a Web Worker)
    ├── proceduralMaterial.glsl (GLSL shader for materials)
    └── babylon.js      (Babylon.js library - or link to CDN)
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.** This should load the Babylon.js scene and display the procedurally generated terrain.
4.  **Navigation:** Use WASD keys to move the camera forward, backward, left, and right. Use the mouse to control camera rotation.
5.  **Parameter Adjustments (If Implemented):** If you have implemented UI controls for material parameters, you can adjust them to see changes in the terrain's appearance in real-time. (This might be a Post-MVP feature if time is tight for the MVP itself).

**Potential Issues (MVP Focus):**

*   **Phase 1:**
    *   Basic noise functions might not produce visually interesting terrain.
    *   Mesh generation and rendering might have initial performance issues if not optimized.
*   **Phase 2:**
    *   Creating a shader that produces even a *basic* procedural material can have a learning curve for GLSL beginners.
    *   Shader performance can become a concern even with simple shaders if not written efficiently.
*   **Phase 3:**
    *   Web Worker implementation can add complexity to asynchronous code management.
    *   Basic seamlessness implementation might still show subtle seams at chunk edges.
    *   Distance-based LOD might cause noticeable popping if not implemented smoothly.

**Future Development (Post-MVP):**

After achieving the MVP, future development will focus on:

*   **Enhancing Visual Quality:** Implementing advanced noise techniques, more sophisticated procedural materials, biomes, foliage, and water.
*   **Performance Optimization:**  Exploring GPU-based voxel generation (Primary Approach), advanced LOD strategies, and further draw call reduction techniques.
*   **Expanding Features:** Adding interactivity, erosion simulation, and potentially gameplay elements (depending on the overall project goals beyond terrain generation).

This MVP serves as a crucial first step in realizing the full vision of Infinite Horizons. It provides a functional foundation for further development and iteration.
